        Since I can remember, I&apos;ve always loved computers and technology, and that was the
        spark I needed to begin studying computer science.

        time learned so much and gained lots of resposabiltys. I can highlight the build of new Rest
        Apis in Java with JAX-RS, the knowledge of Linux machines, and the giant Maven dependencys
        Management.
