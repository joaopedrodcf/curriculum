        <h5>Portuguese full stack developer passionate for web developing</h5>
        <p>
          I always have been passionate with web development and for that reason I have been
          creating since this year began open source software with lots of new languages that I
          wanted to really learn. Started working on a blog project to learn React Js and JS6, and
          learned the basics. After that thaugh that would be great to have a portfolio and to learn
          a little bit more of design, so started this project and learned CSS Grid and Flexbox.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main objective this year is to learn really well how to work on MERN projects and
          create projects on github that the community can contribute and improve, that would be
          really great. I&apos;m always available for new challenges and if you think you have the
          right opportunity for me you can contact me from here.
