        <h5>Portuguese Full-stack developer passionate for web developing</h5>
        <p>
          I always have been passionate with <strong>Web Development</strong> and for that reason I
          have been creating since this year began <strong>Open-source software</strong> with lots
          of new languages that I wanted to really learn. Started working on a blog project to learn
          <strong>React Js</strong> and <strong>JS6</strong>, and learned the basics. After that
          taught that would be great to have a portfolio and to learn a little bit more of design,
          so started this project and learned <strong>CSS Grid</strong> and <strong>Flexbox</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main objective this year is to learn really well how to work on <strong>MERN</strong>
          projects and create projects on github that the community can contribute and improve, that
          would be really great. I&apos;m always available for new challenges and if you think you
          have the right opportunity for me you can contact me from here.
